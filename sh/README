Some small shell wrapper.

------
1. j++

A simple wrapper to invoke g++, useful when compile single simple unit.
and to generate detailed asm code with source code inside.

2. vote.sh

A script to vote on web using fake ip.

3. get_126_contacts.sh

A script which get contact list of netease 126 mail.
It's dependent on netease's email http protocal. So I can't guarantee it will work well.
